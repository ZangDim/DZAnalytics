## Energy Consumption Model

The **Energy Consumption Model** page is designed to help users train and fine-tune an XGBoost model by selecting key parameters. Users can adjust the following:

- **Tuning Parameters**: Choose which hyperparameters to tune for better model performance.
- **Model Parameters**: Set essential attributes of the XGBoost model.
- **Train-Test Split**: Define the percentage of data for training and testing.
- **Target Column Selection**: Specify the target variable for predictions.

This section helps you to quickly train, tune, and evaluate a model on your dataset with a straightforward interface.

üìù **Note**: The tuner‚Äôs parameters have been simplified for faster execution, which may result in slightly less accurate results compared to a fully optimized model.

## Steps to Use the Energy Consumption Model

1. **Select the Target Column**: Choose the `label` column (the dependent variable for prediction).
2. **Choose Parameters to Tune**: Select from `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, and `early_stopping_rounds`.
3. **Set Train-Test Split**: Use a 70% training and 15% testing split for optimal performance (default).
4. **Tune and Train the Model**: Press the **"Tune & Train Model"** button to initiate the training process and view the results.
